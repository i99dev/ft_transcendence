# ft_transcendence

Create a multiplayer online Pong game website using NestJS, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. The website will feature a user-friendly interface, real-time multiplayer Pong game, and a chat system for players to communicate. Users will be able to login using the OAuth system of 42 intranet, create a unique profile, and play against other players through a matchmaking system. The website must be a single-page application, compatible with the latest stable versions of Google Chrome and one additional web browser, and have no unhandled errors or warnings.

## Run Project

To run the project with Docker Compose, you will need to first run the `init_docker.sh` script to set your environment variables. Once you have done that, you can run the following command to build and run the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```
docker-compose up --build

```

Note that this assumes that you have Docker and Git installed on your local machine. The `init_docker.sh` script will set the necessary environment variables for the project.

After running the command, the application should be running on your localhost. You can access the web interface by visiting `http://localhost/api` and the API by visiting `http://localhost`.

If you encounter any issues, be sure to check that the necessary ports are available on your local machine and that you have followed all the necessary installation and setup steps.


# Rules

- The main branch is considered the production branch and should only contain stable and tested code.

- The develop branch is used for development and testing of new features and changes.

- All pull requests should be made to the develop branch and reviewed by at least one other team member before being merged.

- Once changes on the develop branch have been thoroughly tested and are deemed stable, they can be merged into the main branch.

- Any conflicts or issues encountered during the merge process should be resolved before the merge is completed.

- Regularly merge the main branch into the develop branch to ensure that the develop branch is up to date with the production code.

- All merge should be done by team leader or senior developer.

- Any merge should be done with proper comments and description of the changes.

- Continuous integration and automated testing should be set up to ensure that the code on both branches is always functional and stable.

- Any code that is found to be causing issues or errors should be promptly identified and fixed, and the relevant branches updated accordingly.

# Contributors Guide

## Forking the Repository

- Click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner.
- Select your own GitHub account to fork the repository to.

## Cloning the Repository

- Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
- Run the following command to clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git`
- Navigate into the cloned repository: `cd [REPO_NAME]`

## Setting Up the Remote

Run the following command to add the main repository as a remote: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/i99dev/ft_transcendence.git`

## Usage

Run the following command:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```
This script will create .env default file and checks if you have docker and docker setup on your machine.

If all good, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
OR
```bash
docker compose up
```

## Making Changes

- Create a new branch for your changes: `git branch [BRANCH_NAME]`
- Switch to the new branch: `git checkout [BRANCH_NAME]`
- Make your changes and commit them.
